# ViOrb 

Designed to be the last start button replacement tool for all versions of Windows

## Background

I wrote a lot of the original code a long time ago and it was for a completely seperate project, ViStart. It was messy and sloppy but as long as it worked, that's all I initially cared about. I've since tried to tidy up the code to make it more presentable. In the process of doing that I also ended up recoding a lot of it and rediscovering how useful comments would have been. 

## Libraries

- [Windows Unicode API TypeLib](https://github.com/badcodes/vb6/blob/master/%5BInclude%5D/TypeLib/winu.tlb) - Windows API, stores all the API declarations
- [Karl E. Peterson's - HookMe](http://vb.mvps.org/samples/HookMe/) - A clean and elegant means of subclassing 
- [vbAccelerator - GDIPlusWrapper](https://github.com/lee-soft/GDIPlusWrapper) - vbAccelerator's GDIPlusWrapper used for OOP GDIPlus

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo
- Ensure you have Visual Basic 6.0(Service Pack 6) installed
- Grab the WinU TLB - extract the TLB and add as a reference to the project
- Grab the HookMe zip - extract the files (IHookSink.cls, MHookMe.bas) over the placeholder files (IHookSink.cls, MHookMe.bas) and disregard any other files
- Grab the GDIPlusWrapper zip - extract contents to "GDIPlusWrapper" 
- Add the "Clear" function from the Prototype folder to the GDIPlusGraphics class then compile it and add the resulting binary to ViOrb
Release/GDIPlusWrapper.dll

## Comments

I rarely get time to update these projects so I am releasing them here in hopes they can be useful to someone :) I don't expect anyone would care to continue development. I am not against them doing so. If I ever got time I would have liked to have recoded all my projects in C++.
